# HMEI Internship Project
Real-time hurricane hazard risk forecasting and visualization system

The app.py file contains Python code, index.html is in the templates folder, and style.css is in the static folder. Please note this public repository does *not* include the confidential Google Sevice Account credentials used to access the [Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_LvG_YsTzN9JDWHaJgZvPLsq3WZGeOJJEHSBYSEj5uI/edit?usp=sharing) containing hurricane data, so the project will not run as intended. 

To run the Python Flask web app on your personal computer, clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer. Then change the current working directory to your local project and run the app.py file. For example, if the name of local directory is "HMEI_project", the commands to run it are:

```
cd HMEI_project
python3 app.py
```
